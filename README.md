# TFTItems
A program that displays items that can be built in TFT and recommends champions based on those items

Master branch contains the basic python code for the commmand-line based interface.

WithGUI brand contains the code for the GUI version of the program, named TFTItemsGUI.py.  I have also uploaded the executable so you can preview this project.
# To try out the program, go to the withGUI branch, then /dist/TFTItemsGUI.exe

This program was made for programming practice and fun by Jake Sklarew
